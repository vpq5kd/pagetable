# MLPT, a page table simulation API

MLPT is an API designed for teaching students the ins and outs of page table allocation and deallocation. Students may use [`page_allocate`](#page_allocate) to allocate pages for a virtual adress (i.e. map a virtual address to a physical address). After they have used allocate, it is reall helpful to be able to see said mapping. This is exactly what the [translate](#translate) function is meant for.
